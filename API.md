# icp-js-plugin API

The scripting API of [icp-js-plugin](./README.md): the script's inputs, the host
functions it may call, and the Candid coercion rules the typed calls follow.

Scripts run on [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) via
[rquickjs](https://crates.io/crates/rquickjs); it is a small ES2020-class engine
without Node or Web APIs, so no `require`/`import`, no `fetch`, no timers — just
the language plus the host functions documented here.

## The script

The entry script comes from one of two places, and declaring both is an error:

- A **`script` field**, whose value is the JavaScript source inline.
- A file declared under the **`script` key**, whose contents are the JavaScript
  source.

```yaml
sync:
  steps:
    - plugin: ./icp_js_plugin.wasm
      files:
        script: sync.js
        seed: [seed/users.json, seed/roles.json]
      dirs:
        assets: assets
```

Every declared file — the entry script included — is read by the host and handed
to the script via the `files` object, keyed by path. Directories declared in
`dirs` are preopened read-only and reachable with the filesystem functions below.
Declaring `files:`/`dirs:` as a map instead of a plain list tags each entry with
its key, which the script reads back through `fileKeys` / `dirKeys`.

A script runs to completion for a clean sync; throwing (or a runtime error)
fails the step with the thrown message.

Promises have no event loop under them. `async`/`await`, `.then` and
`queueMicrotask` queue jobs, which run after the script's last statement until
the queue is empty — that is when the step ends. A rejection nothing handled
fails the step, so a `throw` inside an async function is as fatal as one at the
top level, and a promise that never settles leaves the rest of its function
unrun. Canister calls are synchronous, so nothing suspends but what the script
suspends itself.

## Sync inputs (globals)

| Name          | Type                        | Description                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `canisterId`  | `string`                    | Textual principal of the target canister.             |
| `canister`    | `Principal`                 | The target canister as a `Principal`.                 |
| `environment` | `string`                    | Environment being synced (e.g. `"production"`).       |
| `identityId`  | `string`                    | Textual principal of the signing identity.            |
| `identity`    | `Principal`                 | The signing identity as a `Principal`.                |
| `proxy`       | `Principal` \| `null`       | Proxy canister if `--proxy` was set, else `null`.     |
| `dirs`        | `string[]`                  | Declared directory paths (preopened read-only).       |
| `dirKeys`     | `object` (key → `string[]`) | Manifest key → the directory paths declared under it. |
| `files`       | `object` (path → `string`)  | Contents of every declared file, by path.             |
| `fileKeys`    | `object` (key → `string[]`) | Manifest key → the file paths declared under it.      |
| `fields`      | `object` (name → `string`)  | Key-value fields declared in the step's `fields`.     |
| `canisterIds` | `object` (name → `string`)  | Every project canister's name → textual principal.    |

`dirKeys` and `fileKeys` cover only the entries declared under a map key; a
plain-list `dirs:`/`files:` has none, and appears only in `dirs`/`files`. One key
may name several paths, so each maps to an array:

```js
// Contents of every file declared under the `seed` key.
let seeds = fileKeys.seed.map((path) => files[path]);
```

`canisterIds` is informational: it maps each named canister in the project
(both `subproject:local` keys and bare local names for same-subproject siblings)
to its textual principal for the environment being synced. Being listed does not
grant permission to call a canister — that still requires declaring it in the
step's `canisters:` list. Wrap a value in `Principal.from(..)` for a `Principal`.

## Canister calls

Every call names its receiver: the global `self` is the canister being synced
(`canisterId`), which is also what an omitted `target` means. A call may instead
target any canister listed in the sync step's `canisters:` — **by name**,
spelled exactly as that list does. A principal is not a target: the host resolves
names so that the permission it checks is the one the manifest granted, and
passing one is an error that names the canister instead. Each call returns the
raw Candid-encoded response bytes as a `Uint8Array`, or throws with the host's
error message.

```js
// Shorthands: the receiver first, then the method, then the argument list —
// which may be omitted where the method takes none.
let resp = callQuery(self, "get_count");
let resp = callUpdate(self, "set_count", candid`(7 : nat64)`);
let resp = callUpdate("ledger", "set_count", candid`(7 : nat64)`);

// General form. Only `method` is required.
let resp = canisterCall({
    method: "transfer",
    arg: candid`(record { to = ${dest}; amount = ${10} })`,
    query: false,   // default false → update; true → query
    direct: false,  // default false → route update through the proxy if configured
    cycles: 0,      // attached to a proxied update call only
    // target: `self` (or omitted) → the canister being synced. Otherwise the
    // name of a canister listed in the step's `canisters:`.
    target: "ledger",
});
```

`arg` takes a `CandidArgs` — what the `candid` tag yields — or a `Uint8Array` of
bytes encoded some other way.

These are the raw calls: the script encodes the argument and decodes the
response itself. [Coerced calls](#coerced-calls) do both against the callee's own
interface instead.

## Metadata sections

```js
let did = canisterMetadata("candid:service"); // → Uint8Array, or null if absent
let text = decodeUtf8(did);

// General form. Only `name` is required.
let section = canisterMetadata({
    name: "candid:args",
    target: "ledger", // omitted → the canister being synced
    direct: false,    // default false → read through the proxy if configured
});
```

The section name is spelled as the wasm module's custom section does, minus the
`icp:public `/`icp:private ` prefix. `null` means the target provably has no
section by that name — including having no module installed at all; a section the
reader may not have is an error. A `direct` read is a certified `read_state`
signed by the sync identity, which reaches a private section only if that
identity controls the target; a proxied read reaches one private to the proxy's
control.

## Environment variables

`canisterSetenv` sets one of a canister's runtime environment variables, leaving
its other variables — and the rest of its settings — as they are. It names its
receiver first, as a call shorthand does.

```js
canisterSetenv(self, "SEEDED_BY", environment);
canisterSetenv("ledger", "ADMIN", canisterIds.backend);

// Optional trailing options; `direct` is the only one.
canisterSetenv(self, "ADMIN", identityId, { direct: true });
```

The value is a string: the canister reads it back verbatim, so anything else is
the script's to render (`String(x)`, or `x.toText()` for a `Principal`). The
update is controller-gated — with `direct` the sync identity must control the
receiver, and by default the proxy configured via `--proxy` makes it, so that is
what must control it. With no proxy configured the sync identity signs either
way.

Set the variable on every sync rather than once. The management canister can only
replace a canister's variables as a whole list, so the host reads them and writes
them back with yours added — and a later `icp deploy` rewrites that list from the
manifest, dropping what a plugin added. Deploy runs the sync phase afterwards, so
a script that always sets it always restores it. For a variable that should not
depend on the plugin running, declare it in the manifest's
`environment_variables` setting instead.

## Candid

An argument is written as Candid source with JavaScript values interpolated
into it, using the `candid` template tag:

```js
let args = candid`(record { to = ${dest}; amount = ${10} })`;
let args = candid`(${[1, 2, 3]}, "literal text")`; // → CandidArgs
```

The template is an argument *list*, parenthesized like the text
`new CandidArgs(text)` takes. Interpolation is not textual: each `${…}` is parsed as a placeholder and
the JavaScript value is grafted onto the parsed value afterwards, so a value can
never inject Candid syntax of its own — `${"1; b = 2"}` is one `text` value, not
a record field.

Each hole becomes the Candid value Candid's own syntax would give the same
literal:

| JavaScript                | Candid                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `null`, `undefined`       | `null`                                         |
| `true` / `false`          | `bool`                                         |
| an integer, or a `BigInt` | a width-undetermined number (`int` by default) |
| a fractional number       | `float64`                                      |
| a string                  | `text`                                         |
| a `Principal`             | `principal`                                    |
| a `Uint8Array`            | `blob`                                         |
| a number class            | that class's type (see below)                  |
| an exact-encoding class   | that class's value (see below)                 |
| an array                  | `vec` (its elements must share one type)       |
| any other object          | `record` of its own enumerable properties      |

A hole inside a string literal interpolates *text* instead, the way JavaScript's
own template literals do — `` candid`("hello ${name}")` `` is one `text` value.

What a hole cannot stand for is anything the parser resolves as it goes: a type
annotation (`${n} : nat64`), a field name, or the contents of a `principal` or
`blob` literal. Those are errors that name the offending `${…}`; spell the
literal out, or interpolate the whole value (`${Principal.from(id)}` rather than
`principal "${id}"`).

### `CandidArgs`

An argument list, and what a call's `arg` takes. It carries the argument
*values*, not only the bytes they encode to untyped, which is what lets a
[coerced call](#coerced-calls) serialize them at the types the callee declares.

```js
let args = candid`(1, "x")`;
args.length;         // → 2
args.toUint8Array(); // → Uint8Array of encoded bytes
args.toValues();     // → [1n, "x"], the arguments as JavaScript values
`${args}`;           // → '(1, "x")', the list as Candid text

new CandidArgs('(42 : nat64)');    // parse an argument list from Candid source
CandidArgs.decode(bytes);          // read back encoded bytes, untyped
```

A one-value `` candid`…` `` also stands for that one value wherever a value is
wanted — a record field, or one argument of a coerced call.

An argument list can also be built from JavaScript values alone, with no source
to write: `candidEncode` takes one value per argument and converts each exactly
as a `${…}` hole is converted, by the table above.

```js
let args = candidEncode({ to: dest, amount: 10 }); // → CandidArgs, one record
let args = candidEncode(1, 'hi');                  // → CandidArgs, two arguments
candidEncode('(42)');                              // → ('(42)'), a text value —
                                                   //   source is CandidArgs' job
let text = candidDecode(args);                     // CandidArgs/Uint8Array → text
```

`candidDecode` reconstructs a structural view without type information, so
record fields appear as their numeric hashes — it is meant for inspection, not
round-tripping.

## Number types

A bare JavaScript number is width-undetermined and encodes as `int`, which is
wrong for a method that declares a fixed width. Since a hole cannot carry a type
annotation, the number classes say which type is meant:

```js
candid`(record { amount = ${new Nat64(10)}; rate = ${new Float32(0.5)} })`;
```

`Nat`, `Int`, `Nat8`, `Nat16`, `Nat32`, `Nat64`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`,
`Int64`, `Float32` and `Float64` each map to the Candid type of the same name.
Each takes a number, a `BigInt` or a string — so a `nat64` past 2^53 stays
exact, `new Nat64("18446744073709551615")` — and throws when the value does not
fit. They are wrappers for encoding: `toString()` reads one back, and in a
string a hole holding one interpolates its decimal.

## Exact-encoding classes

The literal mapping covers what JavaScript syntax denotes. What is left over —
a variant, a canister or function reference, an optional distinct from `null`,
and a tuple of mixed types — has a class that says it exactly:

```js
new Variant("ok");                       // variant { ok }
new Variant("member", { since: 1 });     // variant { member = record { since = 1 } }
new Opt(5);                              // opt 5
new Opt();                               // an absent optional
new Service(canister);                   // service "…"
new Func(canister, "transfer");          // func "…".transfer
new Tuple("x", new Nat32(7));            // record { "x"; 7 : nat32 }
```

`Variant` reads its tag the way a Candid field name is read: `_123_` is the hash
itself, anything else is hashed. `Opt` is for the two cases the coercion rules
cannot spell — an optional holding `null` (`new Opt(null)`) and an optional of an
optional. `Service` and `Func` take a `Principal` or its text. `Tuple` is a
record of numbered fields, which an array cannot be because a `vec` holds one
type.

Each carries the accessors its shape suggests (`.tag`, `.hasValue`, `.canister`,
`.method`, `.length`) and a `toString()` that renders the value as Candid text.

## Coerced calls

A script that knows what a method's arguments *are* need not write any Candid:
the types the callee declares decide how each JavaScript value encodes, and how
the response reads back. The interface comes from the receiver itself, out of its
`candid:service` metadata section.

```js
callTyped("ledger", "transfer", { to: dest, amount: 10 });

const balance = callTyped("ledger", "balance_of", identity); // → decoded JavaScript
```

The first argument is the receiver: a canister name as a call's `target` is, or
**`self`** for the canister being synced. A target is otherwise always a name,
and the canister being synced has none to give — so `self` is the global that
names it.

```js
callTyped(self, "increment");
```

The interface decides whether each call is a query or an update, and is read
once per receiver per run rather than once per call. A method with one result
returns it directly, one with none returns `undefined`, and one with several
returns an array.

The general form takes the options a raw `canisterCall` does, plus an
`interface` to use instead of the one read from the receiver:

```js
canisterCallTyped({
    method: "transfer",
    args: [{ to: dest, amount: 10 }], // the argument list; omitted → no arguments
    target: "ledger",                  // omitted → the canister being synced
    interface: files["ledger.did"],    // a CandidInterface, or `.did` source
    direct: false,
    cycles: 0,
});
```

`args` is the argument *list*, so a method taking one `vec` gets
`args: [[1, 2, 3]]`. A `` candid`…` `` may stand for the whole list instead of an
array.

`CandidInterface` is the parsed `.did` on its own, for encoding and decoding
without calling:

```js
const iface = new CandidInterface(files["backend.did"]);
const iface = CandidInterface.fromCanister("ledger"); // read from its metadata
const iface = CandidInterface.fromCanister(self);

iface.methods();                      // → string[]
iface.signature("get");               // → "(nat64) -> (text) query"
iface.isQuery("get");                 // → boolean
iface.encode("transfer", { … });      // → CandidArgs, at the declared types
iface.decodeResult("transfer", resp); // → decoded JavaScript
iface.decodeArgs("transfer", bytes);  // → an array, one per declared argument
```

### What coerces to what

Every rule is there to make a JavaScript *literal* land on the type the method
declares. A value the declared type cannot account for is an error naming the
argument and the field it sits at — never a guess.

| Declared type                | JavaScript                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bool`                       | a boolean                                                    |
| `text`                       | a string                                                     |
| `nat`, `int`, any fixed width | an integral number, or a `BigInt`                           |
| `float32`, `float64`         | a number                                                     |
| `principal`                  | a `Principal`, or a textual principal                        |
| `service`                    | a `Principal`, a textual principal, or a `Service`           |
| `func`                       | a `Func` — no literal denotes one                            |
| `opt T`                      | `null`/`undefined` for absent, anything else for present     |
| `vec T`                      | an array; a `Uint8Array` where `T` is `nat8`                 |
| `record`                     | an object keyed by field name; an array for a tuple record   |
| `variant`                    | `{ tag: value }`, or `"tag"` for a tag that carries nothing  |
| `null`                       | `null` or `undefined`                                        |
| `reserved`                   | anything                                                     |

An omitted record field is absent where the type says `opt`, `null` or
`reserved`, and an error otherwise; an unknown field is an error rather than
something dropped on the floor. A string is *not* a number — `BigInt` is how
JavaScript writes an integer too wide for a number, so there is nothing a decimal
string could add.

A value one of the exact-encoding or number classes holds passes through as it
stands, as does a `` candid`…` `` — which supplies the whole argument list when
it is a call's only argument, and one value where a single value is wanted.

Decoded results are the same mapping read backwards, so a response goes straight
back into another call: a record is an object keyed by field name, a variant is a
one-entry object, `principal` and `service` are `Principal`s, `func` is a `Func`,
`blob` is a `Uint8Array`, and an absent optional is `null`. `nat`, `int`, `nat64`
and `int64` come back as `BigInt`s, being wider than a number is exact for, which
`JSON.stringify` refuses; the narrower widths and the floats are numbers. `opt
null` and nested optionals are what this loses — `candidDecode` shows a response
exactly.

## Principals

`Principal` is the class of
[icp-js-core](https://github.com/dfinity/icp-js-core), minus
`selfAuthenticating` (which would need a key the plugin has no way to reach), so
code written against `@icp-sdk/core` carries over:

```js
Principal.from("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"); // text, bytes or a Principal
Principal.fromText("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"); // throws if invalid
Principal.fromUint8Array(bytes);
Principal.fromHex("00000000000000020101"); // ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
Principal.anonymous();          // 2vxsx-fae
Principal.managementCanister(); // aaaaa-aa
Principal.isPrincipal(value);

p.toText();       // → string
p.toUint8Array(); // → Uint8Array (raw bytes)
p.toHex();        // → hex string
p.isAnonymous();  // → boolean
p.toJSON();       // → { "__principal__": "<text>" }
`${p}`;           // string coercion → textual principal

p.compareTo(q);   // → "lt" | "eq" | "gt", byte-wise
p.ltEq(q);
p.gtEq(q);
```

`new Principal(..)` takes what `Principal.from` does; icp-js-core keeps its own
constructor protected.

## Encoding helpers

```js
sha256(bytes);         // Uint8Array → 32-byte Uint8Array
encodeUtf8("hi");      // string → Uint8Array
decodeUtf8(bytes);     // Uint8Array → string (throws on invalid UTF-8)
```

The bytes a metadata section or a file comes back as are usually text, which is
what the last two are for.

## Randomness

```js
randomBytes(32); // → Uint8Array of 32 cryptographically random bytes
```

The bytes come from the host's `wasi:random`, so they are unguessable — for a
nonce, a salt, or a fresh subaccount. `Math.random()` is a clock-seeded PRNG:
fine for jitter or a sample, not for anything that must not be predicted. One
call returns at most 1 MiB.

## Filesystem

Read-only access to the directories the step declared under `dirs:`, backed by
WASI. Each is readable at the path the manifest declared it at, and nothing
outside them is readable at all.

```js
readFile("assets/data.json");        // → string (throws if not valid UTF-8)
readFileBytes("assets/logo.png");    // → Uint8Array
readDir("assets");                   // → DirEntries, an iterator of entry names

exists("assets/data.json");          // → boolean
isFile("assets/data.json");          // → boolean
isDir("assets");                     // → boolean
isSymlink("assets/current");         // → boolean, about the link itself
fileSize("assets/logo.png");         // → number of bytes

joinPath("assets", "img", "a.png");  // → "assets/img/a.png"
```

`readDir` yields entry *names*, without the directory they sit in — `joinPath`
puts the two back together. The `DirEntries` it returns is an iterator: `for … of`
walks it, `[...readDir(dir)]` or `Array.from` collects it, and it is consumed
once. The names are read and sorted when `readDir` is called, so an unreadable
directory fails there rather than partway through the loop, and a walk does the
same work in the same order on every run.

```js
for (const name of readDir("assets")) {
    const path = joinPath("assets", name);
    if (isFile(path)) print(path, fileSize(path));
}
```

The reads throw with the underlying error; the predicates answer `false`
instead, so a path that may not be there — or may not be reachable — can be
asked about. Since only the declared `dirs:` are readable, a failed read also
says what the step declared, and a path naming a declared *file* says to read it
from `files`: the host passes those contents inline rather than putting them on
the filesystem.

`joinPath` separates the parts it is given with single slashes however they are
punctuated, dropping empty ones. A part that starts at the root replaces what
came before it, the way pushing onto a path does.

Writes are unavailable because the host preopens directories read-only; a script
that has something to hand back makes a canister call with it.

## Output

`print(..)` and `console.log(..)` write to stdout, shown as transient progress
and discarded when the step ends. `eprint(..)`, `console.error(..)`,
`console.warn(..)` and `console.debug(..)` write to stderr, which is also printed
persistently after the step completes — use them for warnings and summaries the
user should still see. All accept multiple arguments and join them with spaces.
